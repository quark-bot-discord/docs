## Overview

Quark is available in multiple languages, with more being added all the time. The language that
Quark uses is determined by the language set in the server that Quark is in. If you want to change
the language that Quark uses, you can do so by running the `language` command or visiting the
**settings** page on the [dashboard](https://quark.bot/dashboard) for your server.

Languages are maintained by the community, and if you would like to contribute to a language or
add a new language, you can do so by visiting the [Quark language repository](https://github.com/quark-bot-discord/languages)!

Huge thank you to everyone who has contributed to the translations so far!
