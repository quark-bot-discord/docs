## Introduction

While commands are not Quark's main purpose, Quark does offer a few basic commands to
help you manage your server.

Quark's commands generally only send ephemeral messages, and are restricted by default.

<Tip>Want to completely disable Quark's commands for your server? Head over to `Server Settings`
=> `Integrations` => `Quark` and remove the permissions for everyone to use the commands.</Tip>
