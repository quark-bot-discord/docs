## Overview

Permissions are complicated. Very complicated. And messing them up can cause stuff
to go very wrong. This page goes over all the permissions that Quark requires for
each of its features. This allows you to only grant the permissions Quark needs
for the features that your server is using.

<Tip>Granting Quark the **Administrator** permission will prevent any issues caused
by permissions, and allow new features to work automatically.</Tip>

<Warning>This page is about the permissions that **Quark requires** in order to function.
For information on the permissions that a user is required to have in order to run commands,
see the [commands page](/commands).</Warning>

## Logs

### Minimum Permissions

All the permissions on this page also assume that Quark has the following basic set of
permissions where appropriate.

#### Required

| Permission                 | Note                                                                                          |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `VIEW_CHANNEL`             | Required for channels Quark should log (e.g. message events, voice events, channel events)    |
| `SEND_MESSAGES`            | Required for Quark to send messages in the channels it logs to                                |
| `EMBED_LINKS`              | Required for Quark to send embeds in the channels it logs to                                  |
| `SEND_MESSAGES_IN_THREADS` | Required for Quark to send messages in the channels it logs to                                |

<Info>These permissions only need to be granted in the channels where Quark should be
able to access. It is perfectly fine to remove the `VIEW_CHANNEL` for private channels
which you do not want Quark to log, for example.</Info>

#### Optional

- `USE_EXTERNAL_EMOJIS`
