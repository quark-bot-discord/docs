## Introduction

Quark stores a lot of data, which can be a risk to your privacy. This page explains how Quark
stores your data, the measures Quark takes to secure your data and how you can manage it.

## Data Storage

### Files

All files Quark stores are stored with an expiration period in order to guarantee that files
are not stored indefinitely.

Additionally, **all** files are encrypted using AES-256 encryption to ensure that your files
cannot be accessed even by the developers. Files are encrypted using a unique encryption key
for each file, which is never stored but rather generated on-the-fly using data related to the
file, such as the ID of the message that the file was attached to. The code that Quark uses to
handle files is open-source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/quark-bot-discord/file).

### Messages

Quark stores messages for a limited period of time, after which they are deleted. For more
information on this, see the [behaviour](/data/behaviour) page.

When messages are moved to long term storage, similar to files, they are encrypted using AES-256
encryption. The encryption key is generated on-the-fly using data related to the message, such as
the ID of the message and the ID of the channel the message was sent in. The code that Quark uses
to handle messages is open-source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/quark-bot-discord/gluon).
