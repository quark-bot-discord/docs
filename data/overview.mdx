## Introduction

Quark sees upwards of 6 million messages per day and over 150k files every day across thousands of
servers with over 10 million users across all servers. This data is all processed by Quark and stored
using different methods and for different durations. It's impossible for Quark to store all of this
data indefinitely, so Quark has to make decisions on what data to store and for how long.
