### Enhance Your Configuration

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="ghost" title="Filter out particular logs">
  You can filter out logs from being recorded by modifying the **ignore options** on the dashboard.
  By adding a role, user channel, etc. Quark will no longer log events including those attributes to the 
  logging channel. For example if user X deletes their own message or their message is deleted by
  someone else and user X has been added to the **ignore target users** list, this event will not be logged.
  <Note>A target is a user or an object in which an action is **carried out on**. 
  An executor is a user in which an action is **carried out by**.</Note>
  <Note>To add a user to the ignore options, their [user ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID) must be provided</Note>
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Redirect logs to different channels">
  Logs can be setup to be sent to different channels, allowing logs to be more easily managed
  and organised. They can be configured per log category by setting the channel in the dropdown
  for the appropriate category on the dashboard. Alternatively, you can prevent categories of logs
  entirely by disabling the switch.
  <Tip>You can use forum channels to keep all your logs in one place!</Tip>
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Bot integrations">
  Quark is designed to be compatible with other bots! Quark provides the option for native 
  [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me) support to prevent Quark's logs from being rendered useless.
  Quark also has an API to allow further configuration to support your use case.

<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Supercharge your logging">
  For serious servers, [Quark Pro](https://quark.bot/pro) is essential! [Quark Pro](https://quark.bot/pro)
  makes sure you'll never miss a thing that goes on in your server! [Quark Pro](https://quark.bot/pro) can
  be added to your server as a separate bot, alongside [Quark](https://quark.bot/api/invite?source=docs) to
  provide backup logs as well as logging messages up to **8 weeks old** and much more!
  <Tip>If the server has a [Quark Pro](https://quark.bot/pro) subscription, both the normal [Quark](https://quark.bot/api/invite?source=docs) bot and [Quark Pro](https://quark.bot/pro) bot will have Pro features enabled!</Tip>
