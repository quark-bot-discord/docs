## Introduction

For many servers, Quark sends *a lot* of logs. However, it is often useful to refer back
to a specific older log or group of older logs. For this reason Quark is designed to
ease this process of finding the logs you are looking for as much as possible. This
page takes you through the best ways to search through your logs.


## Searching Through Logs

Currently, Quark does not enable users to search through logs via the website.

All log searches must be done within Discord utilising [Discord's search feature](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000468588-Using-Search).

### Finding logs by user

To find a log by a user, you must first obtain their **user ID**. This is a unique number
assigned to every Discord user.

<Tip>Check out [this guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID)
on how to find the user ID</Tip>

Now, insert the following into the search bar in the top right:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Quark" icon="/images/quark.svg" defaultOpen="true">
    ```
    from: Quark Logger#8645 USER_ID_HERE
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Quark Pro" icon="/images/quarkPro.svg">
    ```
    from: Quark Pro#2267 USER_ID_HERE
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>Make sure to replace `USER_ID_HERE` with the ID of the user you are searching for!</Note>
