## Logs

This section is all about Quark's logs (well, what else would you be using Quark for?????).

It will explain in detail the behaviour of logs, the conditions for certain things to occur,
the potential drawbacks of each log, the data which is logged, etc.

Some language or explanations may be quite technical, so if you have any questions about
anything written here or are looking for clarification, do ask in Quark's [support server](https://quark.bot/support).

Logs rely on having data available, which in many cases means Quark must store data in
order for the logs to work. It's possible that in some cases that this data is not available
for a variety of reasons which affects some log types in more adverse ways than others.
In general, logs are designed to be sent whenever an action occurs regardless of whether
all the data available.
