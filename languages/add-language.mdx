## Adding a new language

Hey! You want to add a new language to Quark? That's awesome! Here's how you can do it:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Find the language code">
    The first thing you need to do is find the language code for the language you want to add. You can find a list of language codes [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp).
    </Step>

    <Step title="Fill the language code into the Weblate URL">
    Next, you need to fill the language code into the Weblate URL. The URL should look like this:

    ```html
    https://languages.quark.bot/projects/quark-bot/-/<Language code here>/
    ```
    For example, if you want to add French, the URL would be:

    ```
    https://languages.quark.bot/projects/quark-bot/-/fr/
    ```
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Initialise the first component">
    To initialise the first component, click the **+** button next to it. *This step is required only once.*
