## Adding a new language

Hey! You want to add a new language to Quark? That's awesome! Here's how you can do it:

### Step 1: Find the language code

The first thing you need to do is find the language code for the language you want to add. You can find a list of language codes [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp).

### Step 2: Fill the language code into the Weblate URL

Next, you need to fill the language code into the Weblate URL. The URL should look like this:

```html
https://languages.quark.bot/projects/quark-bot/-/<Language code here>/
```
For example, if you want to add French, the URL would be:

```
https://languages.quark.bot/projects/quark-bot/-/fr/
```

### Step 3: Initialise the first component
Initially, you'll need to initialise the first component. You can do this by clicking on the **+** button next to the component. *You only need to do this once.*
